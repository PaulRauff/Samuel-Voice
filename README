This is an in-progress sound board app, being built to assist a child with severe communication disabilities.

It consists of 2 distinct parts:

1) An Adobe AIR desktop app for positioning and uploading images and sounds.

2) An HTML/JS front end for displaying the icons and playing the sound files uploaded by the AIR application. This is intended to be run on a touch based tablet like the iPad.

Requirements:

You'll need a PHP web server that allows you to dynamically write files to the file system.
The Adobe AIR 2.7 runtime [http://get.adobe.com/air/].
Images and mp3s to add to the sound board.

Deployment:

Upload JS/resources/*.php to your server and note the url location.
Install Adobe AIR and run the exe in AIR/bin/

The AIR app consists of 2 page types. A main index page and a subsection page for each icon in the index page.

In the the running AIR app, find the 'save server' textfield at the top of the index page and enter the location of your .php files (just the directory, not the file names).
In the JS/index.html file, edit line 44 to point to this location too.
